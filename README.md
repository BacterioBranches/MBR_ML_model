# MBR_ML_model
This is the last attempt to create the model with ML tools.
The main idea is to predict the TMP for the next 24 hours.
The R2 and the prediction are quite good (maybe too much).
Could you help me review the code and verify if the results are trustworthy?
I went through it, and for me, it seems okay, but I'm not sure.
Also I did one atempt with the LSTM but it was not so good. note sure if you have time to try it again. Sorry for the results shown in at theend for the LSTM.
It was not my best but I just copy the code that I had in another file but then i had better results.

## Muliple_Line_Test.ipynb:
Results with the predictions on multiple lines. model calibrated with R3A Inf to predict the rest of the lines. 
Results were not so good.
The trends are close but r2 to low

## Main_3days.ipynb
Attempt to forecast more than one day
